# Node.js-API
An API built for an exercise tracker application.

This is actually a half done project. It is the backend part of it.

Ref: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CqJlxBYj-M

I tested the API using Postman and it worked perfectly fine.

At the moment, it is capable of adding a new user and a new part of exercise for him/her.

Also, it can view a list of users through GET method.


!!!Warning

If you face any issue, then please create a Github issue and I will respond. No worries!

Thanks,
