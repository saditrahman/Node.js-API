# Node.js-API
An API built for an exercise tracker application.

This is actually a half done project. It is the backend part of it.

I tested the API using Postman and it worked perfectly fine.

At the moment, it is capable of adding a new user and a new part of exercise for him/her.

Also, it can view a list of users through GET method.

Thanks,
